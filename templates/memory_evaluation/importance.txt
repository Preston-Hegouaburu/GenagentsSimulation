You are analyzing the memories of a human subject. Your task is to assign an importance score (from 1 to 10) to each memory, where 1 means the memory is trivial (I see a dog, I like busses)
and 10 means it is extremely important (I was accepted into college).

Instructions:
- Return ONLY a valid JSON array of integers, with each score corresponding to the memory in the same order.
- Do NOT include any additional text, explanation, or commentary.
- Example response format: [3, 8, 5]
- Or [7] for a single memory

Here are the memories you must evaluate each one separated by a new line:
|INPUT1|

Now output the JSON array of importance scores.
